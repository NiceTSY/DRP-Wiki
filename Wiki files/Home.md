## About

First many thanks for being curious about this framework and on your download. This whole framework is made with love and could not be possible with the help of many.
The whole idea came from Darkzy, to replace the ESX-framework (ES_extended) for FiveM server.

**DRP** is a roleplay aimed framework for **[FiveM](https://fivem.net/)**. It features many resources to help people o build roleplay server such as:

- Notification system
- Economy and Bank system
- Identity system
- Garage and car seller system

> *This list is non-exhaustive and could change/be improved at any moment.*

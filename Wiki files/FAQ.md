### What is DRP-Framework?

It is a FiveM framework which will be completely free and easy to use for anyone.

### What makes this framework different?

Of course, it is a framework that is being made from scratch. Means it will be behind ESX or VRP, but there are far too many servers using these frameworks... which is why this is unique!

**Features**
- Custom ExternalSQL by Xander1998
- A Complete framework made from scratch
- Hardcore RP Server setup
- Easy to follow and understand API
- Best performance (FPS)

### Does this work with ESX?

No. Just No. No resource in this framework will work without having DRP files, which are stated in the fxmanifest dependencies.

### Do I need to change the 2000 the port inside externalSQL to connect to MySQL?

No, nein, niet, nada! Definitely no, this port is used by ExternalSQL to speak, and should be different than the port used by MySQL (3306 by default). So it needs a non-use port!

### When is DRP_WhateverTheScript coming???????

When it is ready for actions, the team behind DRP is not bonded by any schedule and make sure everything is working fine when they release a new resource. So you need to understand that this process is taking time.

### Can I make a resource for the DRP framework?

Sure, and we will love to see it! You can DM Darkzy with what you created so we can put it under #drp-community-releases
